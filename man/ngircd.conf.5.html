<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>ngircd.conf - configuration file of ngIRCd</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>/usr/local/etc/ngircd.conf</strong></p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><strong>ngircd.conf</strong> is the configuration file of the
<strong>ngircd</strong>(8) Internet Relay Chat (IRC) daemon, which must
be customized to the local preferences and needs.</p>
<p>Most variables can be modified while the ngIRCd daemon is already
running: It will reload its configuration file when a HUP signal or
REHASH command is received.</p>
<h1>FILE FORMAT</h1>
<p>The file consists of sections and parameters. A section begins with
the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next
section begins.</p>
<p>Sections contain parameters of the form</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>name</em> = <em>value</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Empty lines and any line beginning with a semicolon (';') or a hash
('#') character are treated as a comment and will be ignored. Leading
and trailing whitespaces are trimmed before any processing takes
place.</p>
<p>The file format is line-based - that means, each non-empty
newline-terminated line represents either a comment, a section name, or
a parameter.</p>
<p>Section and parameter names are not case sensitive.</p>
<p>There are three types of variables: <em>booleans,</em> <em>text
strings,</em> and <em>numbers.</em> Boolean values are <em>true</em> if
they are "yes", "true", or any non-null integer. Text strings are used
1:1 without leading and following spaces; there is no way to quote
strings. And for numbers all decimal integer values are valid.</p>
<p>In addition, some string or numerical variables accept lists of
values, separated by commas (",").</p>
<h1>SECTION OVERVIEW</h1>
<p>The file can contain blocks of seven types: [Global], [Limits],
[Options], [SSL], [Operator], [Server], and [Channel].</p>
<p>The main configuration of the server is stored in the
<em>[Global]</em> section, like the server name, administrative
information and the ports on which the server should be listening. The
variables in this section have to be adjusted to the local requirements
most of the time, whereas all the variables in the other sections can be
left on their defaults very often.</p>
<p>Options in the <em>[Limits]</em> block are used to tweak different
limits and timeouts of the daemon, like the maximum number of clients
allowed to connect to this server. Variables in the <em>[Options]</em>
section can be used to enable or disable specific features of ngIRCd,
like support for IDENT, PAM, IPv6, and protocol and cloaking features.
The <em>[SSL]</em> block contains all SSL-related configuration
variables. These three sections are all optional.</p>
<p>IRC operators of this server are defined in <em>[Operator]</em>
blocks. Links to remote servers are configured in <em>[Server]</em>
sections. And <em>[Channel]</em> blocks are used to configure
pre-defined ("persistent") IRC channels.</p>
<p>There can be more than one [Operator], [Server] and [Channel] section
per configuration file, one for each operator, server, and channel.
[Global], [Limits], [Options], and [SSL] sections can occur multiple
times, too, but each variable overwrites itself, only the last
assignment is relevant.</p>
<h1>[GLOBAL]</h1>
<p>The <em>[Global]</em> section is used to define the main
configuration of the server, like the server name and the ports on which
the server should be listening. These settings depend on your personal
preferences, so you should make sure that they correspond to your
installation and setup!</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Name</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Server name in the IRC network. This is an individual name of the IRC
server, it is not related to the DNS host name. It must be unique in the
IRC network and must contain at least one dot (".") character. When not
set, ngIRCd tries to deduce a valid IRC server name from the local host
name.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>AdminInfo1</strong>, <strong>AdminInfo2</strong>,
<strong>AdminEMail</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Information about the server and the administrator, used by the ADMIN
command. This information is not required by the server but by RFC!</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>HelpFile</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Text file which contains the ngIRCd help text. This file is required
to display help texts when using the "HELP &lt;cmd&gt;" command. Please
note: Changes made to this file take effect when ngircd starts up or is
instructed to re-read its configuration file. Default: a built-in
standard path.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Info</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Info text of the server. This will be shown by WHOIS and LINKS
requests for example. Set to the server software name and version by
default.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Listen</strong> (list of strings)</dt>
<dd>
<p>A comma separated list of IP address on which the server should
listen. If unset, the defaults value is "0.0.0.0" or, if ngIRCd was
compiled with IPv6 support, "::,0.0.0.0". So the server listens on all
configured IP addresses and interfaces by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>MotdFile</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Text file with the "message of the day" (MOTD). This message will be
shown to all users connecting to the server. Please note: Changes made
to this file take effect when ngircd starts up or is instructed to
re-read its configuration file. Default: a built-in standard path.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>MotdPhrase</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>A simple Phrase (&lt;127 chars) if you don't want to use a MOTD
file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Network</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the IRC network to which this server belongs. This name
is optional, should only contain ASCII characters, and can't contain
spaces. It is only used to inform clients. The default is empty, so no
network name is announced to clients.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Password</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Global password for all users needed to connect to the server. The
default is empty, so no password is required. Please note: This feature
is not available if ngIRCd is using PAM!</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PidFile</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This tells ngIRCd to write its current process ID to a file. Note
that the "PID file" is written AFTER chroot and switching the user ID,
therefore the directory the file resides in must be writable by the
ngIRCd user and exist in the chroot directory (if configured, see
above).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Ports</strong> (list of numbers)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Port number(s) on which the server should listen for unencrypted
connections. There may be more than one port, separated with commas
(","). Default: 6667.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ServerGID</strong> (string or number)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Group ID under which the ngIRCd daemon should run; you can use the
name of the group or the numerical ID.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Attention:</strong><br />
For this to work the server must have been started with root
privileges!</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><strong>ServerUID</strong> (string or number)</dt>
<dd>
<p>User ID under which the ngIRCd daemon should run; you can use the
name of the user or the numerical ID.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Attention:</strong><br />
For this to work the server must have been started with root privileges!
In addition, the configuration and MOTD files must be readable by this
user, otherwise RESTART and REHASH won't work!</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>[LIMITS]</h1>
<p>This section is used to define some limits and timeouts for this
ngIRCd instance. Default values should be safe, but it is wise to
double-check :-)</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>ConnectRetry</strong> (number)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The server tries every &lt;ConnectRetry&gt; seconds to establish a
link to not yet (or no longer) connected servers. Default: 60.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>IdleTimeout</strong> (number)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Number of seconds after which the whole daemon should shutdown when
no connections are left active after handling at least one client (0:
never). This can be useful for testing or when ngIRCd is started using
"socket activation" with systemd(8), for example. Default: 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>MaxConnections</strong> (number)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Maximum number of simultaneous in- and outbound connections the
server is allowed to accept (0: unlimited). Default: 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>MaxConnectionsIP</strong> (number)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Maximum number of simultaneous connections from a single IP address
that the server will accept (0: unlimited). This configuration options
lowers the risk of denial of service attacks (DoS). Default: 5.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>MaxJoins</strong> (number)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Maximum number of channels a user can be member of (0: no limit).
Default: 10.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>MaxNickLength</strong> (number)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Maximum length of an user nickname (Default: 9, as in RFC 2812).
Please note that all servers in an IRC network MUST use the same maximum
nickname length!</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>MaxPenaltyTime</strong> (number)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Maximum penalty time increase in seconds, per penalty event. Set to
-1 for no limit (the default), 0 to disable penalties altogether. ngIRCd
doesn't use penalty increases higher than 2 seconds during normal
operation, so values greater than 1 rarely make sense.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>MaxListSize</strong> (number)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Maximum number of channels returned in response to a LIST command.
Default: 100.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PingTimeout</strong> (number)</dt>
<dd>
<p>After &lt;PingTimeout&gt; seconds of inactivity the server will send
a PING to the peer to test whether it is alive or not. Default: 120.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PongTimeout</strong> (number)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If a client fails to answer a PING with a PONG within
&lt;PongTimeout&gt; seconds, it will be disconnected by the server.
Default: 20.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>[OPTIONS]</h1>
<p>Optional features and configuration options to further tweak the
behavior of ngIRCd are configured in this section. If you want to get
started quickly, you most probably don't have to make changes here --
they are all optional.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>AllowedChannelTypes</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>List of allowed channel types (channel prefixes) for newly created
channels on the local server. By default, all supported channel types
are allowed. Set this variable to the empty string to disallow creation
of new channels by local clients at all. Default: #&amp;+</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>AllowRemoteOper</strong> (boolean)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this option is active, IRC operators connected to remote servers
are allowed to control this local server using administrative commands,
for example like CONNECT, DIE, SQUIT etc. Default: no.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ChrootDir</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>A directory to chroot in when everything is initialized. It doesn't
need to be populated if ngIRCd is compiled as a static binary. By
default ngIRCd won't use the chroot() feature.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Attention:</strong><br />
For this to work the server must have been started with root
privileges!</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><strong>CloakHost</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set this hostname for every client instead of the real one. Default:
empty, don't change. Use %x to add the hashed value of the original
hostname.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>CloakHostModeX</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Use this hostname for hostname cloaking on clients that have the user
mode "+x" set, instead of the name of the server. Default: empty, use
the name of the server. Use %x to add the hashed value of the original
hostname</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>CloakHostSalt</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Salt for cloaked hostname hashing. When undefined a random hash
is generated after each server start.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>CloakUserToNick</strong> (boolean)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set every clients' user name and real name to their nickname and hide
the one supplied by the IRC client. Default: no.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ConnectIPv4</strong> (boolean)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set this to no if you do not want ngIRCd to connect to other IRC
servers using the IPv4 protocol. This allows the usage of ngIRCd in
IPv6-only setups. Default: yes.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ConnectIPv6</strong> (boolean)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set this to no if you do not want ngIRCd to connect to other IRC
servers using the IPv6 protocol. Default: yes.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>DefaultUserModes</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Default user mode(s) to set on new local clients. Please note that
only modes can be set that the client could set using regular MODE
commands, you can't set "a" (away) for example! Default: none.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>DNS</strong> (boolean)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If set to false, ngIRCd will not make any DNS lookups when clients
connect. If you configure the daemon to connect to other servers, ngIRCd
may still perform a DNS lookup if required. Default: yes.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Ident</strong> (boolean)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If ngIRCd is compiled with IDENT support this can be used to disable
IDENT lookups at run time. Users identified using IDENT are registered
without the "~" character prepended to their user name. Default:
yes.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>IncludeDir</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Directory containing configuration snippets (*.conf), that should be
read in after parsing the current configuration file. Default: a
built-in directory name when no configuration file was explicitly given
on the command line (check "ngircd --configtest"), none (empty)
otherwise.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>This way no default include directory is used when a possibly
non-default configuration file was explicitly specified using
"--config"/"-f" on the command line which (intentionally) did not
specify an <em>IncludeDir</em> directive.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><strong>MorePrivacy</strong> (boolean)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This will cause ngIRCd to censor user idle time, logon time as well
as the PART/QUIT messages (that are sometimes used to inform everyone
about which client software is being used). WHOWAS requests are also
silently ignored, and NAMES output doesn't list any clients for
non-members. This option is most useful when ngIRCd is being used
together with anonymizing software such as TOR or I2P and one does not
wish to make it too easy to collect statistics on the users. Default:
no.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>NoticeBeforeRegistration</strong> (boolean)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Normally ngIRCd doesn't send any messages to a client until it is
registered. Enable this option to let the daemon send "NOTICE *"
messages to clients while connecting. Default: no.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>OperCanUseMode</strong> (boolean)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Should IRC Operators be allowed to use the MODE command even if they
are not(!) channel-operators? Default: no.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>OperChanPAutoOp</strong> (boolean)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Should IRC Operators get AutoOp (+o) in persistent (+P) channels?
Default: yes.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>OperServerMode</strong> (boolean)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If <strong>OperCanUseMode</strong> is enabled, this may lead the
compatibility problems with Servers that run the ircd-irc2 Software.
This Option "masks" mode requests by non-chanops as if they were coming
from the server. Default: no; only enable it if you have ircd-irc2
servers in your IRC network.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PAM</strong> (boolean)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If ngIRCd is compiled with PAM support this can be used to disable
all calls to the PAM library at runtime; all users connecting without
password are allowed to connect, all passwords given will fail. Users
identified using PAM are registered without the "~" character prepended
to their user name. Default: yes.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PAMIsOptional</strong> (boolean)</dt>
<dd>
<p>When PAM is enabled, all clients are required to be authenticated
using PAM; connecting to the server without successful PAM
authentication isn't possible. If this option is set, clients not
sending a password are still allowed to connect: they won't become
"identified" and keep the "~" character prepended to their supplied user
name. Please note: To make some use of this behavior, it most probably
isn't useful to enable "Ident", "PAM" and "PAMIsOptional" at the same
time, because you wouldn't be able to distinguish between Ident'ified
and PAM-authenticated users: both don't have a "~" character prepended
to their respective user names! Default: no.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PAMServiceName</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>When PAM is enabled, this value determines the used PAM
configuration. This setting allows running multiple ngIRCd instances
with different PAM configurations on each instance. If you set it to
"ngircd-foo", PAM will use /etc/pam.d/ngircd-foo instead of the default
/etc/pam.d/ngircd. Default: ngircd.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>RequireAuthPing</strong> (boolean)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Let ngIRCd send an "authentication PING" when a new client connects,
and register this client only after receiving the corresponding "PONG"
reply. Default: no.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ScrubCTCP</strong> (boolean)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If set to true, ngIRCd will silently drop all CTCP requests sent to
it from both clients and servers. It will also not forward CTCP requests
to any other servers. CTCP requests can be used to query user clients
about which software they are using and which versions said software is.
CTCP can also be used to reveal clients IP numbers. ACTION CTCP requests
are not blocked, this means that /me commands will not be dropped, but
please note that blocking CTCP will disable file sharing between users!
Default: no.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SyslogFacility</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Syslog "facility" to which ngIRCd should send log messages. Possible
values are system dependent, but most probably "auth", "daemon", "user"
and "local1" through "local7" are possible values; see syslog(3).
Default is "local5" for historical reasons, you probably want to change
this to "daemon", for example.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>WebircPassword</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Password required for using the WEBIRC command used by some
Web-to-IRC gateways. If not set or empty, the WEBIRC command can't be
used. Default: not set.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>[SSL]</h1>
<p>All SSL-related configuration variables are located in the
<em>[SSL]</em> section. Please note that this whole section is only
recognized by ngIRCd when it is compiled with support for SSL using
OpenSSL or GnuTLS!</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>CertFile</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>SSL Certificate file of the private server key.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>CipherList</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Select cipher suites allowed for SSL/TLS connections. This defaults
to "HIGH:!aNULL:@STRENGTH:!SSLv3" (OpenSSL) or "SECURE128:-VERS-SSL3.0"
(GnuTLS). Please see 'man 1ssl ciphers' (OpenSSL) and 'man 3
gnutls_priority_init' (GnuTLS) for details.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>DHFile</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Name of the Diffie-Hellman Parameter file. Can be created with GnuTLS
"certtool --generate-dh-params" or "openssl dhparam". If this file is
not present, it will be generated on startup when ngIRCd was compiled
with GnuTLS support (this may take some time). If ngIRCd was compiled
with OpenSSL, then (Ephemeral)-Diffie-Hellman Key Exchanges and several
Cipher Suites will not be available.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>KeyFile</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Filename of SSL Server Key to be used for SSL connections. This is
required for SSL/TLS support.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>KeyFilePassword</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>OpenSSL only: Password to decrypt the private key file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Ports</strong> (list of numbers)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Same as <strong>Ports</strong> , except that ngIRCd will expect
incoming connections to be SSL/TLS encrypted. Common port numbers for
SSL-encrypted IRC are 6669 and 6697. Default: none.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>[OPERATOR]</h1>
<p><em>[Operator]</em> sections are used to define IRC Operators. There
may be more than one <em>[Operator]</em> block, one for each local
operator.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Name</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>ID of the operator (may be different of the nickname).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Password</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Password of the IRC operator.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Mask</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Mask that is to be checked before an /OPER for this account is

<h1>[SERVER]</h1>
<p>Other servers are configured in <em>[Server]</em> sections. If you
configure a port for the connection, then this ngIRCd tries to connect
to the other server on the given port (active); if not, it waits for the
other server to connect (passive).</p>
<p>ngIRCd supports "server groups": You can assign an "ID" to every
server with which you want this ngIRCd to link, and the daemon ensures
that at any given time only one direct link exists to servers with the
same ID. So if a server of a group won't answer, ngIRCd tries to connect
to the next server in the given group (="with the same ID"), but never
tries to connect to more than one server of this group
simultaneously.</p>
<p>There may be more than one <em>[Server]</em> block.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Name</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>IRC name of the remote server.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Host</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Internet host name (or IP address) of the peer.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Bind</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>IP address to use as source IP for the outgoing connection. Default
is to let the operating system decide.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Port</strong> (number)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Port of the remote server to which ngIRCd should connect (active). If
no port is assigned to a configured server, the daemon only waits for
incoming connections (passive, default).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>MyPassword</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Own password for this connection. This password has to be configured
as <strong>PeerPassword</strong> on the other server. Must not have ':'
as first character.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>PeerPassword</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Foreign password for this connection. This password has to be
configured as <strong>MyPassword</strong> on the other server.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Group</strong> (number)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Group of this server (optional).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Passive</strong> (boolean)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Disable automatic connection even if port value is specified.
Default: false. You can use the IRC Operator command CONNECT later on to
create the link.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SSLConnect</strong> (boolean)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Connect to the remote server using TLS/SSL. Default: false.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ServiceMask</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Define a (case insensitive) list of masks matching nicknames that
should be treated as IRC services when introduced via this remote
server, separated by commas (","). REGULAR SERVERS DON'T NEED this
parameter, so leave it empty (which is the default).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>When you are connecting IRC services which mask as a IRC server and
which use "virtual users" to communicate with, for example "NickServ"
and "ChanServ", you should set this parameter to something like "*Serv",
"*Serv,OtherNick", or "NickServ,ChanServ,XyzServ".</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>[CHANNEL]</h1>
<p>Pre-defined channels can be configured in <em>[Channel]</em>
sections. Such channels are created by the server when starting up and
even persist when there are no more members left.</p>
<p>Persistent channels are marked with the mode 'P', which can be set
and unset by IRC operators like other modes on the fly.</p>
<p>There may be more than one <em>[Channel]</em> block.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Name</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Name of the channel, including channel prefix ("#" or "&amp;").</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Topic</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Topic for this channel.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Modes</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Initial channel modes, as used in "MODE" commands. Modifying lists
(ban list, invite list, exception list) is supported.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>This option can be specified multiple times, evaluated top to
bottom.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Autojoin</strong> (boolean)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Should ngIRCd automatically join ("autojoin") all users to this
channel on connect? Note: The users must have permissions to access the
channel, otherwise joining them will fail!</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>KeyFile</strong> (string)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Path and file name of a "key file" containing individual channel keys
for different users. The file consists of plain text lines with the
following syntax (without spaces!):</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>user</em> : <em>nick</em> : <em>key</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>user</em> and <em>nick</em> can contain the wildcard character
"*".<br />
<em>key</em> is an arbitrary password.</p>
<p>Valid examples are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*:*:KeY<br />
*:nick:123<br />
~user:*:xyz</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key file is read on each JOIN command when this channel has a key
(channel mode +k). Access is granted, if a) the channel key set using
the MODE +k command or b) one of the lines in the key file match.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong><br />
The file is not reopened on each access, so you can modify and overwrite
it without problems, but moving or deleting the file will have not
effect until the daemon re-reads its configuration!</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>HINTS</h1>
<p>It's wise to use "ngircd --configtest" to validate the configuration
file after changing it. See <strong>ngircd</strong>(8) for details.</p>
