	If you find any bugs or you have any ideas on developing ngIRCD, it
	is best to put them into the <a href="bugtracker.php">Bug-Tracker</a> of the
	ngIRCd. There is also a
	<a href="#ml">mailing list</a> for discussions and questions concerning
	the ngIRCd (and you don't need an account for posting).

	Alexander Barton
	(<a href="mailto:alex&#64;barton.de">alex&#64;barton.de</a>)
	had the idea to develop the ngIRCD; he is responsible for big
	parts of today's soucre code.

<p>
	BTW: we are always happy any patches or additional peers!
